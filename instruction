# How to Take a Sleep in a Forest

**This instruction is most relevant for Central and Eastern European geographical conditions.**

*Remember: Always follow local regulations and obtain necessary permits for overnight forest stays in your country. First check the legal conditions and regional regulations (Is it legal? Is it safe and aprropriate?).*

## 1. Why sleep in the forest?
- RECREATIONAL: Connecting with nature reduces stress and improves mental wellbeing (forest air contains beneficial compounds that enhance sleep quality, a break from artificial light and noise improves natural sleep cycles). Read more about 'Forest bathing' (known as Shinrin-yoku in Japanese) here:
    https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6589172/
- NECESSITY: emergency situation (SHTF option, getting lost, etc.). In this scenario you must rely on your EDC (every-day-carry gear) and improvisation (survival/bushcraft skills). EDC example here:

## 2. How to prepare to sleep in a forest
- Use your local forest administrator's webpage to find a spot dedicated to recreational wild camping.
- Check the local weather forecast and inform someone of your planned location and duration of your adventure. 
- If you are using a car to get there, leave your contact info on a piece of paper in the front window.

Things you should consider:
- using a proper functional outfit (including a second set to sleep in).
- take toiletry bag (including medical drugs if needed).

Things you need (gear):
- Get paper map of terrain you plan to visit.
- Pack sleeping bag rated for expected temperatures.
- Bring insulated sleeping pad for ground insulation.
- Pack waterproof tarp or tent for weather protection (rain).
- Bring water bottle, headlamp, basic first aid kit, knife, fire source (matches, lighter), few meters of rope (ex. paracord), working gloves, piece of plastic bag and emergency whistle.
- Take care of your electronics (full charge the battery, take powerbanks and drybags to secure devices from water).

> Protip: do the checklist of your gear and check it before the trip.

## 3. How to choose a place to sleep
> Protip: Make sure that you approximately know where you are (point it on the map) - in case of emergency (calling the rescue) and for your safe and comfort.
- Find flat, dry ground away from dead trees and branches.
- Stay at least 30-60 meters (100-200 feet) from water sources to avoid wildlife encounters (but keep close to a water source).
- Check for hazards like wild animals spots, plants, mushrooms, etc.
- Avoid low spots where cold air and moisture collect.
- Consider wind direction and natural windbreaks.

## 4. How to set up the place
- Clear ground of rocks, branches, and sharp objects.
- Lay your tarp or tent footprint for moisture barrier.
- Set up shelter with entrance facing away from wind.
- Store food in sealed containers away from sleeping area (ex. hang it on the tree).
- Keep essential items within reach (dry and safe).
- Dig a firepit and collect natural fuel to prepare the campfire (dry branches of dead wood). Store the dirt from pit in a plastic bag - in case you need to extinguish the fire suddenly (or improvement for cleaning).

## 5. How to clean the place after sleep
- Pack all your gear and personal items.
- Remove any trace of campfire if used (use water to flood firepit).
- Return natural materials like branches to original locations.
- Check area thoroughly for forgotten items.
- Fill any holes or depressions made during setup.
- Return to civilisation.
> Protip: Make sure that you leave your camp site as close to natural condtion as it was before.
